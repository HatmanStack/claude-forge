# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Forge will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **`Bash` removed from default mutation set** — A typical `/forge:pipeline` run invokes `Bash` hundreds of times (git status, npm test, ls, cat, file inspection, etc.). With `Bash` in the default mutation set, those spans drowned out the `Write`/`Edit` activity that actually shows what the subagent changed. Default `MUTATION_TOOLS` is now `Write,Edit,MultiEdit`. Add `Bash` back via `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_MUTATION_TOOLS="Write,Edit,MultiEdit,Bash"` if you want it
- **`MUTATION_TOOLS` is now env-overridable** — same pattern as `INNER_TOOL_BLOCKLIST`, via `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_MUTATION_TOOLS`. README env-var table updated

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Tool spans for SendMessage continuations** — `_find_subagent_transcript` now strips the `(continued)` suffix that the SendMessage naming helper adds, so SendMessage post-events resolve back to the same per-subagent JSONL as the original Agent spawn. Also added a direct lookup for `to=<agent_id>` form (16-char hex) that bypasses the description scan. `_emit_subagent_inner_spans` now filters tool_uses by `ts_ns >= anchor_start_ns` so each SendMessage continuation only emits its own window of tool calls instead of re-emitting all prior tool spans for that agent
- **Documented `forge-trace` version-selection bug** — README's `forge-trace` shell-function tip now uses `find ... | sort -V | tail -1` instead of `find ... | head -1`. With multiple cached plugin versions (e.g. after a few `/plugin install` upgrades), `head -1` returns whatever filesystem iteration produces first, which silently picks an old version and rolls the deployed hook back to a stale snapshot. `sort -V | tail -1` always picks the latest
- **Documented three-command upgrade flow** — README "Updating tracing" section now leads with a ⚠️ that plugin updates require three commands, not two: `/plugin marketplace update` (refreshes index), `/plugin install forge@claude-forge` (actually upgrades the installed plugin to the new version), then `forge-trace` (deploys the refreshed hook). Skipping the middle step leaves the installed plugin pinned to its original version and `forge-trace` silently copies the stale cached hook

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Subagent Inner Tool Spans (synthetic)** — When an Agent-spawned subagent finishes, `_handle_subagent_post` now walks the subagent's per-agent JSONL transcript at `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` and emits one synthetic `tool:<name>` span per `tool_use` block, parented to the subagent anchor. Real wall-clock timestamps from the transcript lines, full `tool.input` and `tool.output` (truncated), `agent.name` for filtering, ERROR span status when the subagent's tool failed. Workaround for [Claude Code issue #34692](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34692) (parent hooks don't fire for subagent tool calls) and [#18392](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18392) (frontmatter hooks not executed for subagents) — there is no live hook-based path for inner-tool visibility, so we synthesize retroactively from the transcript Claude Code writes anyway. Honors existing `_should_trace_inner` gating: mutational tools by default, others require `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_INNER=1`, blocklist drops Read/Glob/Grep/etc.
  - **Caveat:** spans materialize *after* the subagent finishes, not in real-time. Wall-clock timestamps are accurate; the spans just appear in Jaeger when the parent's `PostToolUse Agent` fires.

### Changed

- **SendMessage Span Naming** — `SendMessage` Pre/Post events previously fell through to the literal `"subagent"` fallback because the SendMessage payload has no `description` field (it carries `to`/`summary`/`message`). Result: long pipelines showed `subagent:subagent` spans and lost track of which agent was being addressed. Now: at every `Agent` Pre, we save a `name → description` map to `_agent_names.json`. At `SendMessage` Pre, we resolve `tool_input.to` (role name OR agent_id) against that map and use the original description with a `(continued)` suffix. New attributes on SendMessage anchors: `sendmessage.to`, `sendmessage.summary`, `agent.prompt` now picks `message`/`content` instead of being empty. New `agent.name` attribute on all subagent spans

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Mutational Tool Tracing** — `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, and `Bash` calls inside each subagent now emit child spans by default (no env var required), surfacing what each subagent actually changed/ran. Disable with `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_MUTATIONS=0`. `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_INNER=1` still exists for tracing read-only inner tools (Read/Glob/Grep/etc.) when deep debugging is needed
- **Eight Additional Hook Events** wired into `trace_subagents.py`:
  - `SessionStart` — canonical root-anchor trigger (UserPromptSubmit becomes the defensive fallback for resumed sessions)
  - `SessionEnd` — canonical end-of-session signal
  - `StopFailure` — API-error session aborts now produce a `session_complete` span with `is_error=true` instead of leaving a dangling `_root.json`
  - `PostToolUseFailure` — failed Agent calls now emit a `subagent_result` span with error status (was: orphan state files, no result span)
  - `PermissionRequest` / `PermissionDenied` — emit `permission_*:<tool>` spans parented to the active subagent so blocked operations are visible in Jaeger instead of silent
  - `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` — emit a `compaction` span with real duration, anchoring post-compaction agent behavior changes in time
  - `InstructionsLoaded` — emits an `instructions.loaded` span with the file path so trace consumers can see when CLAUDE.md or rule files shape behavior
- **Tracing Update Documentation** — README "Updating tracing" subsection covers the `/plugin marketplace update claude-forge` → `forge-trace` cycle so users know how to refresh the shared hook after a release. Includes a `forge-trace` shell-function tip for one-line invocation

### Changed

- **`session_complete` Idempotent** — `Stop`, `SessionEnd`, and `StopFailure` all funnel through one helper that flips a `complete_emitted` flag in `_root.json`. Stop now safely fires per-turn without producing duplicate session_complete spans
- **Plugin Source Protocol** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` declares `source: url` with an explicit `https://` URL instead of `source: github`, avoiding Claude Code's SSH default and the resulting `No ED25519 host key is known for github.com` failures on machines without SSH set up
- **Plugin Version** bumped to `1.5.0` in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` (was lagging at 1.3.0/1.4.0)

### Fixed

- **Failed Agent Calls Now Visible in Jaeger** — Agent tool calls returning `is_error: true` previously triggered `PostToolUseFailure` (a separate event from `PostToolUse`), which was unhandled. State files orphaned, no `subagent_result` span emitted. Now handled with forced `is_error=true` on the result span

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Jaeger Tracing for Subagents** — `hooks/trace_subagents.py` emits OpenTelemetry spans for every agent/tool invocation, producing a parent/child trace tree viewable in Jaeger. Gated by `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACING=1`, with `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_INNER` to toggle inner-tool spans
- **Tracing Installer** (`bin/install-tracing.sh`) — One-shot script that provisions the hook, writes `settings.local.json` entries, and (optionally) starts a local `jaegertracing/jaeger:latest` container. README documents setup, env vars, and the Jaeger UI workflow
- **Planner Deep-Analysis Step** — `skills/pipeline/planner.md` now runs an explicit deep-analysis pass before drafting phases, surfacing cross-cutting risks and dependencies that were previously implicit

### Changed

- **Supply-Chain Hardening** — All third-party GitHub Actions SHA-pinned across `release.yml` and `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`. Dependabot given a 3-day cooldown on `github-actions` updates so compromised releases have time to be caught before adoption

### Fixed

- **Plugin Install** — Corrected `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` source so `/plugin install forge@claude-forge` resolves the plugin correctly
- **Tracing Hook Review Findings** — `_env_truthy()` allowlist stops `CLAUDE_FORGE_TRACE_INNER=0` from being read as truthy; `_safe_name()` sanitizes `session_id`/`tool_use_id` before they touch the filesystem (rejects traversal, SHA1 fallback for empty/dot inputs); `_safe_flush()` replaces four 2s `force_flush` calls with a 1s timeout that swallows exceptions so a slow OTLP endpoint cannot block tool execution; debug log moved to `~/.cache/claude-forge/hook.log` (0600, opt-in via `CLAUDE_FORGE_HOOK_DEBUG=1`, no raw payloads). Installer shell-quotes `HOOK_CMD` via `printf %q` for paths with spaces. `settings.local.json.example` broadens matchers to `.*` and adds `UserPromptSubmit`/`Stop` so root and session-complete spans emit
- **Dependabot Auto-Merge** — Dropped `--required` from `gh pr checks --watch`; the flag failed on dependabot branches because no required checks are configured for those branch patterns

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Dependabot Auto-Merge Workflow** — `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` merges patch and minor dependency updates automatically after CI passes. Uses `dependabot/fetch-metadata@v2` with an `if:` condition on `update-type` to skip major updates, `gh pr checks --watch --required` to enforce CI gate, and `gh pr merge --auto --squash` for clean history

### Changed

- **Planner Pre-Planning Context** — Planner agent now reads `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and relevant memory files before writing any plan. Extracted conventions (package manager, runtime, build/test/deploy commands, user preferences) are incorporated into Phase-0.md so the implementer inherits project context. Prevents plans that contradict established stack choices (e.g. using pip when the project uses uv)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- **Agent Teams Feature Flag** — Documented `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` as a required environment variable. The `Agent` and `SendMessage` tools used for multi-agent orchestration are now gated behind this experimental flag. Added setup instructions to README and a prerequisites section to ARCHITECTURE.md

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Plugin Format** — Restructured repo as a Claude Code plugin with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and `marketplace.json` for marketplace distribution. Install via `/plugin marketplace add hatmanstack/claude-forge`
- **Skill Run Manifest** — Every skill logs a run entry to `.claude/skill-runs.json` on completion, tracking skill name, date, plan directory, and pipeline verdict across projects

### Changed

- **Skills Location** — Moved from `.claude/skills/` to `skills/` at repo root (plugin format requirement). All internal path references updated
- **GAN Framing** — Replaced "applies GAN principles" and "GAN-style loops" with "adapts the adversarial feedback loop from GAN architecture" and "adversarial loops" throughout. Aligns repo language with external content (freeCodeCamp article, blog post)
- **README** — Documents both plugin install (`/plugin install forge@claude-forge`) and standalone install (`cp -r skills/`). Updated file structure diagram

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Combined Audit Skill** (`/audit`) — Single entry point to run any combination of eval, health, and doc audits. Asks scoping questions one at a time, spawns up to 5 agents in parallel, produces all intake docs in one directory for a single `/pipeline` run
- **Unified Audit Flow** (`flows/audit-flow.md`) — Merged-plan model: one planner reads all intake docs and creates one plan with phases tagged `[HYGIENIST]`, `[IMPLEMENTER]`, `[FORTIFIER]`, `[DOC-ENGINEER]`. Tags route each phase to the correct implementer/reviewer pair
- **Verification Stage** — Lightweight final gate replacing expensive re-evaluation. One reviewer agent verifies specific `file:line` findings from intake docs instead of re-running 3-5 evaluator/auditor agents
- **Signal Validation** — Intake skills now validate completion signals (`EVAL_HIRE_COMPLETE`, `AUDIT_COMPLETE`, `DOC_AUDIT_COMPLETE`) before writing intake docs. Truncated agent output is detected and reported
- **VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED Signals** — New pipeline signals persisted to feedback.md for state recovery across interruptions
- **Per-Pillar Threshold Overrides** — Users can set custom thresholds or exclude specific pillars from the remediation gate
- **Cross-Evaluator Calibration** — Normalizes scores across evaluator lenses before planning; divergences ≥3 points flagged as signal

### Changed

- **Agent Reuse via SendMessage** — Planner, Plan Reviewer, Implementer, and Reviewer agents are spawned once and continued via `SendMessage` for subsequent iterations. Preserves context instead of re-reading codebase from scratch each iteration
- **Strict Agent Spawning Rules** — One agent at a time, no duplicates, no per-phase planners, no background agents, no parallel agents in the pipeline orchestrator
- **Orchestrator Never Runs CI** — Only agents run tests, linters, and builds within their own execution. Orchestrator only spawns agents, reads signals, and routes work. Prevents duplicate CI runs and race conditions
- **Intake Questions** — Added "known pain points" (universal) and "deployment target" (health). Merged scope+constraints into single questions. Dropped redundant "context" question from eval
- **Token Budget** — Changed from hard 50k target to flexible guideline. Planner sizes phases to the work; single-phase plans OK for small scopes
- **Distinct Intake Filenames** — `health-audit.md` and `doc-audit.md` replace shared `audit.md`, eliminating frontmatter-based routing
- **Pipeline Protocol** — Updated signal table with VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED and all intake completion signals. Updated file ownership table with intake docs
- **NO-GO Rollback Path** — Documented re-entry routing: plan-level issues go to Planner, implementation-level to affected Implementer

### Fixed

- Stale re-evaluation/re-audit references removed from all role prompts and flow files
- Flow diagram labels updated from "Re-Audit"/"Re-Evaluate" to "Verify"
- State recovery ordering: VERIFIED checked before PHASE_APPROVED-for-all-phases
- feedback.md creation guaranteed before any stage (orchestrator creates if missing)
- audit-flow pre-flight no longer validates evaluator/auditor files (intake-only)
- doc-health template removed stale `ci_platform` field
- Grep pattern regression fixed: `def\b`/`class\b` word boundaries instead of trailing-space code spans

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Repo Evaluation Pipeline** (`/repo-eval`) — 3-evaluator hiring panel (The Pragmatist, The Oncall Engineer, The Team Lead) scoring codebases across 12 pillars with GAN-loop remediation until all pillars reach 9/10
- **Repo Health Pipeline** (`/repo-health`) — Technical debt audit across 4 vectors (architectural, structural, operational, hygiene) with Option C topology: auditor (pure assessment) → planner → plan reviewer → hygienist (subtractive cleanup) → health reviewer → fortifier (additive guardrails) → health reviewer → re-audit
- **Doc Health Pipeline** (`/doc-health`) — 6-phase documentation drift detection (discovery, comparison, code examples, link integrity, config/env, structure) with remediation and drift prevention tooling
- **Pipeline Type Routing** — `/pipeline` now detects intake document type (`brainstorm.md`, `eval.md`, `health-audit.md`, `doc-audit.md`) and routes to the appropriate flow file
- **Flow Files** — `flows/repo-eval-flow.md`, `flows/repo-health-flow.md`, `flows/doc-health-flow.md` defining stage sequences, agent spawning, GAN loops, and re-evaluation criteria per pipeline type
- **10 Role Prompts** — `eval-hire.md`, `eval-stress.md`, `eval-day2.md`, `health-auditor.md`, `health-hygienist.md`, `health-fortifier.md`, `health-reviewer.md`, `doc-auditor.md`, `doc-engineer.md`, `doc-reviewer.md`
- **State Recovery** — All flow files include resume detection for interrupted pipelines, matching the main pipeline's Stage 0 pattern

### Changed

- **Pipeline SKILL.md** — Added `Write` to allowed-tools, type detection routing in Pre-Flight, explicit frontmatter parsing instructions for `audit.md`
- **Pipeline State Recovery** — Added Stage 0 for detecting prior progress across all stages (plan approval, phase progress, final review) before re-entering the pipeline

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Adversarial Development Pipeline** — GAN-style generator/discriminator loops for AI-assisted development
- **Brainstorm Skill** (`/brainstorm`) — Interactive design session producing structured specs grounded in codebase exploration
- **Pipeline Skill** (`/pipeline`) — Automated build cycle with 5 agent roles: Planner, Plan Reviewer, Implementer, Code Reviewer, Final Reviewer
- **Signal Protocol** — Structured communication between agents via `PLAN_COMPLETE`, `REVISION_REQUIRED`, `PLAN_APPROVED`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `PHASE_APPROVED`, `GO`, `NO-GO`
- **Immutable Plans with Mutable Feedback** — Plan documents created once, all review feedback flows through `feedback.md` with OPEN/RESOLVED tracking
- **Phase-0 Architecture Blueprint** — Shared conventions document inherited by all implementation phases
- **Zero-Context Engineer Simulation** — Plan Reviewer validates that plans are followable without prior codebase knowledge
- **Adversarial Plan Review** — Deadlock search, false positive verification, ambiguity search, missing context detection
- **Token Budgeting** — Phases sized to ~50k tokens to fit single agent context windows
- **Date-Based Plan Versioning** — `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-slug` naming decoupled from release versions
