An adversarial development pipeline for Claude Code. Features go through iterative plan-implement-review cycles where separate AI agents check each other's work in a GAN-like architecture — generators (Planner, Implementer) produce artifacts, discriminators (Plan Reviewer, Code Reviewer, Final Reviewer) validate them, and feedback loops drive convergence.

```

Each agent runs in its own context window with a fresh perspective. Feedback flows through a shared `feedback.md` file — plan documents are never mutated by reviewers.

## Skills

### `/brainstorm` — Interactive Design Session

Explores your codebase, asks 5-15 clarifying questions (preferring multiple choice), and produces a structured design spec.

**Output:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-slug/brainstorm.md`

```
/brainstorm I want to add real-time notifications to the dashboard
```

### `/pipeline` — Automated Build Cycle

Reads the brainstorm doc and runs the full plan-implement-review pipeline. Each role is a separate agent with its own context window.

```
/pipeline 2026-03-12-notifications
```

## Pipeline Roles

| Role | Type | Agent Context | Responsibility |
|------|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Planner** | Generator | Fresh per invocation | Creates phased implementation plans (~50k tokens/phase) |
| **Plan Reviewer** | Discriminator | Fresh per invocation | Validates plan logic, file existence, dependency chains, adversarial checks |
| **Implementer** | Generator | Fresh per phase | Executes plan using TDD, makes atomic commits |
| **Code Reviewer** | Discriminator | Fresh per phase | Verifies implementation against spec and Phase-0 conventions |
| **Final Reviewer** | Discriminator | Fresh (once) | Holistic integration review, production readiness assessment |

## Signal Protocol

Agents communicate through structured signals that the orchestrator routes:

| Signal | From | To | Meaning |
|--------|------|----|---------|
| `PLAN_COMPLETE` | Planner | Plan Reviewer | Plan ready for review |
| `REVISION_REQUIRED` | Plan Reviewer | Planner | Issues found, check feedback.md |
| `PLAN_APPROVED` | Plan Reviewer | Implementer | Plan is sound, start building |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` | Implementer | Reviewer | Phase code ready for review |
| `CHANGES_REQUESTED` | Reviewer | Implementer | Issues found, check feedback.md |
| `PHASE_APPROVED` | Reviewer | Next phase / Final Reviewer | Phase code is solid |
| `GO` | Final Reviewer | Done | Production ready |
| `NO-GO` | Final Reviewer | Planner / Implementer | Issues categorized and routed back |

## Feedback Channel

All review feedback flows through `docs/plans/<plan_id>/feedback.md`. This keeps plan documents clean and gives both review roles a consistent communication channel.

```markdown
## Active Feedback

### CODE_REVIEW - Iteration 1 - Phase 2, Task 3

> **Consider:** The test expects a 401 status code. Are you returning
> the correct HTTP status in your error handling?

**Status:** OPEN

## Resolved Feedback

### PLAN_REVIEW - Iteration 1 - Phase 1, Task 2

> **Consider:** This says "Modify src/utils/date.js" but the file
> doesn't exist. Should this be "Create"?

**Status:** RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Changed to "Create" and added prerequisite setup steps
```

Reviewers use rhetorical questions (Consider / Think about / Reflect) to guide the generator's thinking rather than prescribing exact fixes.

## Plan Versioning

Plans use date-based versioning with a feature slug:

```
docs/plans/
├── 2026-03-01-user-auth/
│   ├── brainstorm.md
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── feedback.md
│   ├── Phase-0.md
│   ├── Phase-1.md
│   └── Phase-2.md
├── 2026-03-12-notifications/
│   ├── brainstorm.md
│   └── ...
```

- Decoupled from release versions (no collision with existing tags)
- Self-sorting chronologically
- Greppable by feature name
- Plans are committed as audit artifacts

## Installation

### Per-project (recommended for teams)

Copy the `.claude/skills/` directory into your project:

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/ /path/to/your-project/.claude/skills/
```

Anyone who clones the project gets the skills automatically.

### Personal (all your projects)

Copy into your personal Claude Code config:

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

Available in every project on your machine.

## File Structure

```
.claude/skills/
├── brainstorm/
│   └── SKILL.md              # Interactive Q&A skill
└── pipeline/
    ├── SKILL.md              # Orchestrator (spawns and routes agents)
    ├── planner.md            # Planning architect role prompt
    ├── plan_reviewer.md      # Plan review role prompt
    ├── implementer.md        # Implementation engineer role prompt
    ├── reviewer.md           # Code review role prompt
    ├── final_reviewer.md     # Final review role prompt
    └── pipeline-protocol.md  # Signal protocol and feedback channel spec
```

## Safety Rails

- **Max 3 iterations** per GAN loop before surfacing to the user
- **NO-GO** from final review stops and asks for human input (no auto-retry)
- **Reviewers cannot modify source code** — only feedback.md
- **Plan documents are immutable** once created (only Planner can revise)
- **Progress reports** between stages keep the user informed
- **Implementer stops and asks** rather than guessing on ambiguous instructions

## Configuration

### Commit Attribution

The pipeline creates commits through the Implementer agent. By default, commits use whatever git identity is configured in your project. For AI-assisted commits, you may want to add attribution.

**Option A: Co-Authored-By trailer (recommended)**

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so the Implementer agent includes it automatically:

```markdown
All commit messages must end with:
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Option B: Separate committer identity**

Configure a project-level git identity for AI commits:

```bash
git config user.name "your-name (via Claude)"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

**Option C: No attribution**

The pipeline works fine with your default git config. Commits will appear as yours.

Choose whichever approach fits your team's audit and attribution requirements. The pipeline does not enforce any specific attribution — that's your project's decision, configured in your project's `CLAUDE.md` or Phase-0.
